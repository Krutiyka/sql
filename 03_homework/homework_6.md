Incorporating ethics and equity into database management should always include data privacy and security consideration. In my opinion those two attributes must be treated seriously in the current world. There should be a data governance and control team being engaged to ensure the data is classified correctly and managed/used within technology processes accordingly. We can use an example of customer and vendor data that was analyzed in Homework-4 and Homework-5. Both customer and vendor data should be handled confidentially and any data analysis with these data elements should adhere to the processes set by enterprise protect teams and the access to these data elements should be given only to the restricted number of authorized users.

I have extensive experience in working with data, where we are considering ethical elements as an integral part of the technology and project delivery processes. In my opinion, data governance and control teams or at least a representative from that team should participate in each project delivery process review. Though the work of these team members is not visible on a high level but is very valuable and should be promoted more in todayâ€™s society.
